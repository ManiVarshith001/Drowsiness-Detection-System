# Drowsiness Detection and Prevention System Using AI

## Description
The **Drowsiness Detection and Prevention System** is an AI-powered safety solution designed to monitor drivers in real-time and prevent accidents caused by fatigue. The system leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to analyze facial expressions, detect signs of drowsiness, and trigger alerts to ensure driver safety.

### **Key Features**
- **Real-time Face Monitoring**: Uses a camera to track the driverâ€™s face and detect key landmarks.
- **Drowsiness Detection**: Analyzes eye closure duration, yawning frequency, and head movements to identify fatigue.
- **Alert System**: Triggers an alarm upon detecting drowsiness
- **Vehicle Intervention**: Optionally integrates with vehicle control systems to gradually slow down and stop the vehicle.
- **AI-based Analysis**: Utilizes deep learning models such as CNNs and U-Net for accurate detection.

### **Technology Stack**
- **Dataset**: WIDER FACE Dataset for training
- **AI Model**: U-Net for segmentation, CNN for feature extraction
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, ONNX
- **Hardware**: Camera module, Arduino, buzzer, motor control unit

This system is highly beneficial for personal vehicles, fleet management, and logistics companies, significantly reducing accident risks and enhancing road safety.
